# @champify/env [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@champify/env.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@champify/env)

@champify/env is a type-safe environment variable management tool for Node.js and TypeScript.

It is not a replacement, but rather a complement to tools like [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) that help you manage environment variables in your Node.js applications. See more on why below.

## Why use @champify/env?

* ðŸ«¥ Have you ever deployed code that broke production because an environment variable wasn't defined? 
* ðŸ˜± Is your codebase peppered with so many references to `process.env` that you couldn't even compile a list of all of the environment variables used in your project if you tried?
* ðŸ¤” Have you ever thought to yourself, "I really wish I could access environment variables with type-safety"? (of course you have)

If so, look no further: @champify/env just might solve all of your problems.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @champify/env
```

## Usage

First, define all of the environment variables that your application needs in one place (say, `env.ts`).

`env.ts`:
```typescript
import { Env } from '@champify/env';

// Define all env vars that your application needs.
const e = new Env({ vars: ['PORT', 'DATABASE_URL', 'API_KEY'] });
```

You can also define a handler that will be called when an env variable can't be found. This is useful for logging or throwing an error.

```typescript
const e = new Env({ 
  vars: ['PORT', 'DATABASE_URL', 'API_KEY'],
  missingHandler: async (key: string) => {
    metrics.put('env.missing', { key });
  }
});
```

Then, in each file, initialize only the environment variables needed within the local context.

```typescript
import { e } from './env.js';
const env = await e.init(['PORT']);
console.log(env.PORT);
```

Whenever you access properties on the `env` object, not only do you get type safety, but you also get some nifty autocompletion.

<br/>

If `PORT` is not defined in your `.env` file or in your production environment, your application will throw the following error when `init` is called, (hopefully) preventing your application from silently breaking.

```bash
Missing required env var: PORT (production)
```

You can also mark certain environment variables as optional or required only.

```typescript
const env = await e.init(['PORT', e.optional('API_KEY'), e.required('DATABASE_URL')]);
```

## Type Safety

### Basic Guardrails

If you try to initialize an environment variable that was not defined in the main list, your code will not compile.

```bash
src/error.ts:73:27 - error TS2322: Type '"OHNO_NOT_DEFINED"' is not assignable to type '"PORT" | "DATABASE_URL" | "API_KEY" | EnvVarDefinition<"PORT" | "DATABASE_URL" | "API_KEY">'.

73 const env = await e.init(['OHNO_NOT_DEFINED']);
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Likewise, if you try to access an environment variable that was not initialized within the specific context, your code will also not compile.

```bash
src/index.ts:74:5 - error TS2339: Property 'DATABASE_URL' does not exist on type 'EnvVarContext<"PORT">'.

74 env.DATABASE_URL
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

### Initialization Safety

If you have a function or a class that requires a certain env var, you can use `EnvVarContext` to enforce initialization within that context. E.g.,

```typescript
import { EnvVarContext } from '@champify/env';

const env = await e.init(['DATABASE_URL']);

// This code requires API_KEY specifically, so call that out.
const callApi = async (env: EnvVarContext<'API_KEY'>) => { /* do stuff! */ }

// TYPE ERROR!
await callApi(env);
```

Here's the type error you'd see:

```bash
src/index.ts:77:15 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'EnvVarContext<"DATABASE_URL">' is not assignable to parameter of type 'EnvVarContext<"API_KEY">'.
  Property 'API_KEY' is missing in type 'EnvVarContext<"DATABASE_URL">' but required in type 'EnvVarContext<"API_KEY">'.

77 await callApi(env);
                 ~~~
```

How cool is that?

## Background

There are several tools to ensure that `process.env` is populated with the environment variables defined in your `.env`. In fact, we use [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) at [Champify](https://champify.io), but we still found it was too easy to do "all of the right things" and still face problems.

For example, say you deployed code that did something like this (taken straight from the dotenv docs):

```typescript
require('dotenv').config();

s3.getBucketCors({Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET}, function(err, data) {});
```

If `S3_BUCKET` isn't defined in your `.env` file, you'll get a runtime error deep within application logic. This code might even be wrapped in an error handler that could potentially swallow the error and cause a silent failure.

Nothing we could find off the shelf provided a method to prevent these sorts of errors outright, so we built it ourselves.

`@champify/env` requires you to define all environment variables that your application uses in one place, making it easy to see what your application depends on. It also forces users to initialize only the environment variables that are needed within a specific file.

I could go on, but the best way to understand the benefits of @champify/env is to check it out for yourself.

## A Note on API Stability

This project is in active development, so it's possible there might be some changes before it hits v1.0.

That being said, we'll respect semver, so you can expect that any breaking changes will come with a new major version.

## TypeScript

This package is meant for use with TypeScript. If you're not using TypeScript, you might not get much out of this, since much of the benefit of using this package is in surfacing type errors at compile time.
